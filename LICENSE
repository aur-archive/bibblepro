* Bibble 5 Pro may be installed and used either by (A) the named license holder with the software and license installed on one or more computers or (B) a single household or workgroup using the software on a single workstation, but not both (A) and (B).  This license may be installed on more than one machine, on any supported operating system, provided that only a single instance of Bibble 5 Pro using this license is used at a time.  This is not a concurrent use license.

* Bibble 5 Lite may be installed and used either by the named license holder with the software and license installed on one or more computers.  This license may be installed on more than one machine of a single operating system chosen at the time of purchase.  This is not a concurrent use license.

* You may make backups of the installers for Bibble 5 Pro and/or Bibble 5 Lite and you may backup installed versions of Bibble 5 Pro and/or Bibble 5 Lite for personal use.  You may not transmit these backups or your license to any 3rd parties for purposes other than archiving.

* Bibble Labs publishes updates to Bibble 5 Pro and Bibble 5 Lite from time to time to add features, fix issues, or otherwise improve the product.  Your license will remain valid for the version of Bibble 5 Pro that you purchased for the duration specified at the time your license was issued (for normal retail licenses, the license is perpetual).  You will receive free upgrades to subsequent versions of Bibble Labs products in the same class of product ("Pro" or "Lite") for no less than one year from the day you receive your license, regardless of the size or content in the subsequent version.  If Bibble 5.1 is released 1 day after your license is issued, you will receive that upgrade totally free of charge.  If Bibble 6 is released 11 months after your license is issued, you will receive that upgrade totally free of charge.  Bibble Labs may choose to extend the one-year timeframe for particular customers or for particular upgrades at its sole discretion.  YOU WILL ALWAYS BE ABLE TO USE THE VERSION YOU PURCHASED OR ANY VERSION TO WHICH YOU YOU RECEIVE A FREE UPGRADE so long as you own a computer capable of installing and running the software.

You may access this copy through a network, provided that you have obtained an individual Bibble 5 Pro license for each workstation that will access Bibble through the network. For instance, if 8 different workstations will access Bibble 5 Pro on the network, each workstation must have its own Bibble Pro license, regardless of whether they use Bibble 5 Pro at different times or concurrently.
